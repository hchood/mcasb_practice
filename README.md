## MCASB Practice App

This project is a workout app for actors.  I'm an actor, and wanted an app that would help me build a daily practice out of the exercises we do at my acting studio (that's the [MCASB](http://www.michaelchekhovactorsstudioboston.com/MCASB/Welcome.html), in case you were wondering).

The first iteration will have the following features:

- Admins (instructors) can add exercises and build workouts
- Users (actors) can view exercises and workouts
- Users can log that they've completed a workout
- Users can view their workout history

I plan to build an API to integrate with mobile, as well.
